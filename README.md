# Uganda-Karamoja
# Business problem

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts and pest and disease outbreaks.

# Project Overview


The project aims to analyze agricultural datasets related to the Karamoja region of Uganda. The project aims at understanding the impact of drought, pest infestations, and disease outbreaks on crop productivity. The analysis will help identify patterns, vulnerabilities, and potential interventions to improve regional food security.

# Objectives


Develop data-driven insights and recommendations to enhance crop productivity in Karamoja
Identify the crops doing well in Karamoja despite the adverse conditions
Identify the crops that have the least productivity to come up with ways to improve their productivity

  # Datasets Used


1.   Uganda Karamoja District Crop Yield Population
2.   Uganda Karamoja Subcounty Crop Yield Population

   # Merging the datasets
This is to make the work appear cleaner

# Data Cleaning
Cleaning of data ensures the good quality and reliability of our analysis. There are various methods of cleaning data. These include: Handling missing values, handling duplicates, standardizing data, removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, etc.

# Data Exploration
To get a quick overview of our new dataset after merging and cleaning.

# Data Analysis

# Conclusion


1.   The district with the highest Maize production is Nakapiririt.
2.   The district with the lowest maize production is Moroto
3.   The district with the highest sorghum production is Kotido
4.   The district with the lowest sorghum production is Moroto

# Recommendations

*   Develop an alert system that automatically notifies farmers and NGOs of emerging threats like droughts, pests, or diseases based on predictive models.
*   Promote the cultivation of drought-resistant varieties of sorghum and maize. 
*   Focus on educating farmers about best practices in drought management, soil health improvement, and pest control.
*   Develop heatmaps of crop productivity, identifying high-risk zones that require urgent attention, and allowing NGOs to allocate resources more effectively.
