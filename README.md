# Uganda-Karamoja
Business problem
Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts and pest and disease outbreaks.

The project aims to analyze agricultural datasets related to the Karamoja region of Uganda. The project aims at understanding the impact of drought, pest infestations, and disease outbreaks on crop productivity. The analysis will help identify patterns, vulnerabilities, and potential interventions to improve regional food security.
