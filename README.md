# Uganda-Karamoja
Business problem
Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks.

Project overview
The project aims to analyze agricultural datasets related to the Karamoja region of Uganda. The project aims at understanding the impact of drought, pest infestations and disease outbreaks on crop productivity. The analysis will help identify patterns, vulnerabilities, and potential interventions to improve food security in the region.

Objectives
Develop data-driven insights and recommendations to enhance crop productivity in Karamoja
Identify the crops doing well in Karamoja despite the adverse conditions
Identify the crops that have the least productivity in order to come up with ways to improve their productivity
